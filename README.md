  The DMI50K dataset covers five mainstream tampering models, each contributing 10,000 tampered images, which significantly influence image editing and tampering. These models include BrushNet (BN) , Paint by Example (PE), Inpaint Anything (IA), PowerPaint (PP), and Repaint (RP).	
  The DMI50K dataset encompasses five prevalent tampering types, representing the main trends in current image tampering techniques. These types include instance-guided inpainting, text-guided inpainting, context-aware inpainting, object removal, and shape-guided inpainting. To simulate real-world image tampering and enhance the dataset's practicality, all masks are meticulously hand-drawn.
  The DMI50K dataset comprises 50,000 tampered images, providing ample data resources for researchers and ensuring the dataset's diversity and coverage. These images span various scenes and subjects, including natural landscapes, urban environments, and portraits, offering rich material for the training and testing of tampering detection algorithms.
